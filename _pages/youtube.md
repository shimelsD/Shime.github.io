# My undergrad final year project at the University of Gondar, 2019
 * This project entitled "Dental clinic information system(DCIS)" was developed as a final year project in 2019, aimed to advance the manual operation of [University of Gondar Specialized Hospital](https://hospital.uog.edu.et/) dental clinic. I have used Java GUI(Swing), MySQL database & JasperReport to develop the system.
